Now the swinging bridge
is quieted with creepers
like our tendrilled life

By the old temple,
peach blossoms;
a man treading rice.

All the day long-
yet not long enough for the skylark,
singing, singing.

Cedar umbrellas, off
to Mount Yoshimo for
the cherry blossoms.

Temple bells die out.
The fragrant blossoms remain.
A perfect evening!

Flower
under harvest sun - stranger
To bird, butterfly.

With a warbler for 
a soul, it sleeps peacefully, 
this mountain willo

souls' festival
today also there is smoke
from the crematory

The shallows -
a crane's thighs splashed
in cool waves

the whole family
all with white hair and canes
visiting graves

Won't you come and see
loneliness? Just one leaf
from the kiri tree.

The she cat -
Grown thin
From love and barley.

the warbler sings
among new shoots of bamboo
of coming old age

On the white poppy,
a butterfly's torn wing
is a keepsake

Tremble, oh my gravemound, 
in time my cries will be 
only this autumn wind

Scarecrow in the hillock
Paddy field --
How unaware! How useful.

Sleep on horseback,
The far moon in a continuing dream,
Steam of roasting tea.

This first fallen snow 
is barely enough to bend 
the jonquil leaves

Wrapping dumplings in 
bamboo leaves, with one finger 
she tidies her hair

Eaten alive by
lice and fleas -- now the horse
beside my pillow pees

The winter leeks
Have been washed white --
How cold it is!

Behind this door
Now buried in deep grass
A different generation will celebrate
The Festival of Dolls.

The clouds come and go, 
providing a rest for all 
the moon viewers

The petals tremble
on the yellow mountain rose -
roar of the rapids

On Buddha's deathday, 
wrinkled tough old hands pray - 
the prayer beads' sound

From time to time
The clouds give rest
To the moon beholders..

The winter storm
Hid in the bamboo grove
And quieted away.

The summer grasses
All that remains
Of brave soldiers dreams

With every gust of wind,
the butterfly changes its place
on the willow.

How wild the sea is, 
and over Sado Island, 
the River of Heaven

husking rice
a child squints up
to view the moon

Petals of the mountain rose
Fall now and then,
To the sound of the waterfall?

On the cow shed
A hard winter rain;
Cock crowing.

Crossing long fields,
frozen in its saddle,
my shadow creeps by

shaking the grave
my weeping voice
autumn wind

under my tree-roof
slanting lines of april rain
separate to drops

Year's end, all 
corners of this 
floating world, swept.

The morning glories 
bloom, securing the gate 
in the old fence

The first snow
the leaves of the daffodil
bending together

Passing through the world
Indeed this is just
Sogi's rain shelter

Even that old horse
is something to see this
snow-covered morning

Long conversations 
beside blooming irises - 
joys of life on the road

The butterfly is perfuming
It's wings in the scent
Of the orchid.

On New Year's Day 
each thought a loneliness
as winter dusk descends

Ungraciously, under 
a great soldier's empty helmet, 
a cricket sings

The passing spring
Birds mourn,
Fishes weep
With tearful eyes.

I like to wash,
the dust of this world
In the droplets of dew.

Morning and evening
Someone waits at Matsushima!
One-sided love

The banana tree 
blown by winds pours raindrops 
into the bucket

On this road
where nobody else travels
autumn nightfall

Winter seclusion - 
sitting propped against 
the same worn post

I'm a wanderer 
so let that be my name - 
the first winter rain

It is with awe
That I beheld
Fresh leaves, green leaves,
Bright in the sun.

Deep into autumn
and this caterpillar
still not a butterfly

Winter downpour - 
even the monkey 
needs a raincoat.

Cold as it was
We felt secure sleeping together
In the same room.

Clouds -
a chance to dodge
moonviewing.

But for a woodpecker 
tapping at a post, no sound 
at all in the house

scent of plum blossoms
on the misty mountain path
a big rising sun

None is travelling
Here along this way but I,
This autumn evening.

The first day of the year:
thoughts come - and there is loneliness;
the autumn dusk is here.

An old pond
A frog jumps in -
Splash!

Lightening -
Heron's cry
Stabs the darkness

Clouds come from time to time -
and bring to men a chance to rest
from looking at the moon.

In the cicada's cry
There's no sign that can foretell
How soon it must die.

Poverty's child -
he starts to grind the rice,
and gazes at the moon.

Won't you come and see
loneliness? Just one leaf
from the kiri tree.

Temple bells die out.
The fragrant blossoms remain.
A perfect evening!

This old village--
not a single house
    without persimmon trees.

Staying at an inn
where prostitutes are also sleeping--
    bush clover and the moon.

Taking a nap,
feet planted
    against a cool wall.

When the winter chrysanthemums go,
there's nothing to write about
    but radishes.

Winter garden,
the moon thinned to a thread,
    insects singing.

Midfield,
attached to nothing,
    the skylark singing.

Heat waves shimmering
one or two inches
    above the dead grass.

Wrapping the rice cakes,
with one hand
    she fingers back her hair.

Teeth sensitive to the sand
in salad greens--
    I'm getting old.

bush-clover flowers -
they sway but do not drop
their beads of dew

As they begin to rise again
Chrysanthemums faintly smell,
After the flooding rain

Moonlight slanting
through the bamboo grove;
    a cuckoo crying.

The morning glory also
turns out
    not to be my friend.

A man, infirm
With age, slowly sucks
A fish bone.

The squid seller's call
mingles with the voice
    of the cuckoo.

The dragonfly
can't quite land
    on that blade of grass.

How admirable!
to see lightning and not think
    life is fleeting.

Spring rain
leaking through the roof
    dripping from the wasps' nest.

a cuckoo cries
and through a thicket of bamboo
the late moon shines

Fleas, lice,
a horse peeing
    near my pillow.

First winter rain--
even the monkey
    seems to want a raincoat.

A wild sea-
In the distance over Sado
The Milky Way

The oak tree:
not interested
    in cherry blossoms.

Stillness--
the cicada's cry
    drills into the rocks.

What fish feel,
birds feel, I don't know--
    the year ending.

you make the fire
and I'll show you something wonderful:
a big ball of snow!

Bush warbler:
shits on the rice cakes
    on the porch rail.

Coolness of the melons
flecked with mud
    in the morning dew.

Cold night: the wild duck,
sick, falls from the sky
    and sleeps awhile.

Blowing stones
along the road on Mount Asama,
    the autumn wind.

a strange flower
for birds and butterflies
the autumn sky

A cold rain starting
And no hat --
So?

A field of cotton--
as if the moon
    had flowered.

Chilling autumn rains 
curtain Mount Fuji, then make it 
more beautiful to see

At a hermitage:
    A cool fall night--
getting dinner, we peeled
    eggplants, cucumbers.

First snow
falling
    on the half-finished bridge.

A weathered skeleton 
in windy fields of memory, 
piercing like a knife

Winter solitude--
in a world of one color
    the sound of wind.

Spring: 
A hill without a name 
Veiled in morning mist. 

The beginning of autumn: 
Sea and emerald paddy 
Both the same green. 

The winds of autumn 
Blow: yet still green 
The chestnut husks. 

A flash of lightning: 
Into the gloom 
Goes the heron's cry.

Bitter-tasting ice - 
Just enough to wet the throat 
Of a sewer rat.

First day of spring--
I keep thinking about
    the end of autumn.

Sick on my journey, 
only my dreams will wander 
these desolate moors

A cicada shell;
it sang itself
    utterly away.

Awake at night--
the sound of the water jar
    cracking in the cold.

old pond.....
a frog leaps in
water's sound

Don't imitate me;
it's as boring
    as the two halves of a melon.

A caterpillar,
this deep in fall--
    still not a butterfly.

A monk sips morning tea,
it's quiet,
    the chrysanthemum's flowering.

Waking in the night; 
the lamp is low, 
the oil freezing. 

It has rained enough 
to turn the stubble on the field 
black. 

Winter rain 
falls on the cow-shed; 
a cock crows. 

The leeks 
newly washed white,- 
how cold it is! 

The sea darkens; 
the voices of the wild ducks 
are faintly white. 

Ill on a journey; 
my dreams wander 
over a withered moor.

Autumn moonlight--
  a worm digs silently
    into the chestnut.

A snowy morning--
by myself,
    chewing on dried salmon.

A bee
staggers out
    of the peony.
