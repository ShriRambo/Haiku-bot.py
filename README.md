## Some Samples (Generated with Markov Chain)

```
            A caterpillar   
still greens--
above the skylark singing.
```

```
         A caterpillar 
still not thinking 
to want a rain shelter
```

```
On New Year's empty helmet, 
a cricket of the house
            near my pillow.
```

```
The sea darkens; 
the daffodil
bending at a post
```

```
           This first snow
falls from the water jar  
   on the year ending rain
```

```
Moonlight--
getting long-  
yet not a but
```

```
On Buddha's child
see loneliness 
of winter grasses
```

```
Coolness of road on horse 
besided life 
is heron's cry
```
